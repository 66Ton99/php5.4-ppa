  * Now uses system timezone database.

  Debian PHP now makes use of the system wide timezone database from the
  tzdata package, making sure any updates there are automatically used
  by PHP aswell. Note that this requires that the PHP process has access
  to /etc/localtime and /usr/share/zoneinfo (this is usually the case).

  * New php5-dbg package.

  We are now shipping a php5-dgb package which will greatly aid in finding
  the cause of many crashes that you may experience.  So if you are going to
  report a bug for a reproducible crash, please install this package before
  sending a backtrace.

  * New libapache2-mod-php5filter package.

  We are now also shipping a new libapache2-mod-php5filter package which
  uses the "Apache 2.0 filter-module support via DSO through APXS".
