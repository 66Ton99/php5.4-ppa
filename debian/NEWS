php5 (5.3.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * mod_php disabled in userdirs.

  The default Debian libapache2-mod-php5 package now disables the PHP
  engine on ~/public_html directories when mod_userdir is enabled, for
  security reasons.  Although discouraged, it can be re-enabled by
  commenting the <IfModule mod_userdir.c> block in
  /etc/apache2/mods-available/php5.conf

  * PHP 5.2 compatibility settings

  Given the short time to the Squeeze release freeze, the
  short_open_tag setting has been turned On again (upstream now
  defaults to Off on the php.ini files.) However, the request_order and
  auto_globals_jit settings continue to be the default from upstream
  ("GP" and On, respectively.)

php5 (5.2.11.dfsg.1-2) unstable; urgency=high

  * Maximum number of file uploads per request limited

  To prevent Denial of Service attacks by exhausting the number of
  available temporary file names, upstream introduced the max_file_uploads
  option in 5.3.1 and 5.2.12.

  Due to the nature of this new option a default limit has been set
  to 50, hoping it is sensible enough to not to cause disruptions on
  existing services.
  The value of this new limit can be changed in the php.ini file.

  If you installed the php5-suhosin extension there was a limiting
  mechanism in place already. In this case you may want to make sure
  the new limit imposed by PHP itself is not smaller than suhosin's.

php5 (5.2.6-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Now uses system timezone database.

  Debian PHP now makes use of the system wide timezone database from the
  tzdata package, making sure any updates there are automatically used
  by PHP aswell. Note that this requires that the PHP process has access
  to /etc/localtime and /usr/share/zoneinfo (this is usually the case).

  * New php5-dbg package.

  We are now shipping a php5-dgb package which will greatly aid in finding
  the cause of many crashes that you may experience.  So if you are going to
  report a bug for a reproducible crash, please install this package before
  sending a backtrace.

  * New libapache2-mod-php5filter package.

  We are now also shipping a new libapache2-mod-php5filter package which
  uses the "Apache 2.0 filter-module support via DSO through APXS".
