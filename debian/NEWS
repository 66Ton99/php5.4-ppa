php5 (5.2.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  in addition to this new upstream release, we are now moving towards
  having the suhosin patch (http://www.hardened-php.net/suhosin/index.html)
  enabled by default.  we're not yet ready to enable it, but the packages
  can be built with the patch enabled with very little effort.  if you
  are interested in trying this out, just do:

  apt-get install build-essential fakeroot
  apt-get build-dep php5
  cd php5-5.2.3
  export DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=suhosin
  dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot

  or something similar, preferably on your development box :)

  if you try this out, please report successes and/or failures to us at
  pkg-php-maint@lists.alioth.debian.org.
