Description: server-side, HTML-embedded scripting language (meta-package)
 This package is a meta-package that, when installed, guarantees that you
 have at least one of the four server-side versions of the PHP5 interpreter
 installed.  Removing this package won't remove PHP5 from your system, however
 it may remove other packages that depend on this one.
 .
 PHP5 is an HTML-embedded scripting language. Much of its syntax is borrowed
 from C, Java and Perl with a couple of unique PHP-specific features thrown
 in. The goal of the language is to allow web developers to write dynamically
 generated pages quickly.
